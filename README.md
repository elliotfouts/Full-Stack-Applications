### Cōdify (Group Project)

For many software engineers, the job hunting process can become overwhelming. Between low success rates, complicated interview processes, and employers that may not even respond, it is difficult to keep track of valuable data. We built Cōdify to solve this problem.

Cōdify is a PWA created to organize and analyze the job application process for software developers. It provides a centralized location to save job post URLs, contact information, job offers, application status, and much more.

### Grocer-ease (Individual Project)
Grocer-ease is a MERN application built to organize and simplify grocery shopping for my family. It is powered by a REST API which web scrapes product pictures from google images in order to deliver a streamlined and intuitive UI that even young members of my family became accustomed to very quickly. I used mongoose as my ODM and Material UI as my component framework. 

During the Covid 19 Pandemic, my family had trouble organizing grocery lists and my mother was becoming overwhelmed by constant random text messages containing bits and pieces of recipes. I was in the middle of a quarter of school so I built a super quick JQuery and SQL grocery list which can be viewed [here](). However, after a couple weeks of use I began to wonder how I could improve both the UI and the backend. In my addition, problems arose such as not knowing which family members added certain items and ambiguity over which products to purchase. I solved these problem by building Grocer-ease. By providing Oauth sign in strategies as well as local authentication options, I can track who added what as well as collect timestamps. By web scraping google images, I can provide automated specificity to items on the list.
