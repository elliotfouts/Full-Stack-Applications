# Full Stack Applications 

### Grocer-ease (Full-stack engineer)
Grocer-ease is a MERN application built to organize and simplify grocery shopping for my family. It is powered by a REST API which web scrapes product pictures from google images in order to deliver a streamlined and intuitive UI that even young members of my family became accustomed to very quickly. I used mongoose as my ODM and Material UI as my component framework.

### Codify (Backend engineer)
For many software engineers, the job hunting process can become overwhelming. Between low success rates, complicated interview processes, and employers that may not even respond, it is difficult to keep track of valuable data. We built Cōdify to solve this problem.

Cōdify is a PWA created to organize and analyze the job application process for software developers. It provides a centralized location to save job post URLs, contact information, job offers, application status, and much more.
